                        <p>Hufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.</p>
                        <p>The emblematic animal was a badger, and yellow and black were its house colours. The Head of Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was the House's patron ghost.</p>
                        <p>Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth, and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. The Hufflepuff point hourglass contained yellow diamonds. Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrate strong abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.</p>
                        <p>Students belonging to this house were known to be hard-working, friendly, loyal, honest and rather impartial. It might be that due to their values, Hufflepuffs were not as competitive as the other houses, and were more modest about their accomplishments. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its students.</p>
                        <p>Hufflepuffs were known to have a strong moral code, and a sense of right and wrong. Hufflepuffs were usually accepting of everyone. Students in Hufflepuff were known to value everyone and treat them as equal.</p>
