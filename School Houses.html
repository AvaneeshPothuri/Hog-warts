                        <h1>School Houses</h1>
                        <p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was divided into four Houses: Gryffindor, founded by Godric Gryffindor; Hufflepuff, founded by Helga Hufflepuff; Ravenclaw, founded by Rowena Ravenclaw; and Slytherin, founded by Salazar Slytherin.</p>
                        <h4>House system</h4>
                        <p>Houses at Hogwarts were both the living and learning communities for its students. Each year's group of students in the same House shared the same dormitory and many classes. The houses competed throughout the school year, by earning and losing points for behaviour. The House with the most points won the House Cup. Each House also had its own Quidditch team that competed for the Inter-House Quidditch Cup. These two competitions bred rivalries between the Houses, the greatest of which was that between Gryffindor and Slytherin.</p>
                        <h4>Sorting</h4>
                        <p>In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders handpicked students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and each "put some brains" in it, creating the Sorting Hat to choose future students for each House. At the beginning of each school year, the magical Sorting Hat was placed on each new student's head during the Sorting Ceremony.</p>
                        <p>The Sorting Hat announced the House the student was to join. Before beginning the Sorting Ceremony, it sang a short song about the founding of the school and the four Houses; the Sorting Hat's songs were different every year, and the Hat was said to take all year composing the next one (according to Ronald Weasley). Every so often it would sing of mortal peril at the school. The students said that it picked up tips from Dumbledore's office.</p>
